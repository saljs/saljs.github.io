## About me:
I am a computer science student who recently attained my bachelors of science
degree from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in 2019 and am now working
toward attaining my PhD. My current research interests include AI, specifically
machine learning and unsupervised learning, as well as robotics. My interest in
robotics stems from the fact that it combines so many aspects of computer
science, everything from AI to low-level systems programming. I also enjoy
designing home automation sensors and actuators as a hobby.

I am currently employed at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse as a web
developer, where I add new features and improve performance and refactor
code for the main university website as well as internal tools.

In my spare time I enjoy working on electronics projects, reading, and spending
time with my family. I also consider myself something of an amateur
herpetologist and enjoy keeping and talking to people about a wide variety of
reptile species.
