## About me:
I am currently a full-stack web developer, working at the University of
Wisconsin - La Crosse, where I also received my Bachelor's degree in Computer
Science in 2019. My professional interests include a wide range of topics within
computer science, ranging from microcontrollers and robotics to distributed
computing and machine learning. I've been creating software since 2012, and love
learning about new technologies and new ways of thinking about writing code.

In my spare time I enjoy working on electronics projects or my homelab, reading,
and spending time with my family. I also consider myself something of an amateur
herpetologist and enjoy keeping and talking to people about a wide variety of
reptile species.
